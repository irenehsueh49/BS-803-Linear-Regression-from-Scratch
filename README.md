# Linear Regression from Scratch in R
Hello! Welcome to my function I created that performs multiple linear regressions from scratch for my SPH BS 803 (Statistical Programming for Biostatisticians) final project. First, upload your dataset. Then, input 3 things into my function called "linear_regression": dataset name, outcome variable name, and predictor variable(s). Make sure to put the outcome and predictor variables in quotes and enter them exactly how they show up in the dataset! When you're done, Hit Ctl+Enter and watch the magic happen. Compare the output from my function to the output from the built in lm() function and be amazed. 

Feel free to use to the example datasets I've uploaded called [savings.rda](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/BS-803-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/blob/main/savings.rda) and [galapagos_turtles.txt](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/BS-803-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch/blob/main/galapagos_turtles.txt). I tidied my datasets using Tidyverse functions, but that's not necessary as long as you're comfortable with how your dataset looks.
