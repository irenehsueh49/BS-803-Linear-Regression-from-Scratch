# BS-803-Project
Hello! Welcome to my function I created that performs linear regressions from scratch. First, upload your dataset. Then, input 3 things into my function called "linear_regression": dataset name, outcome variable name, and predictor variable(s). Make sure to put the outcome and predictor variables in quotes and enter them exactly how they show up in the dataset! When you're done, Hit Ctl+Enter and watch the magic happen. Compare the output from my function to the output from the build in lm() function and be amazed. 

Feel free to refer to the example datasets I've uploaded called savings.rda and galapagos_turtles.txt. I tidied my datasets using Tidyverse functions, but that's not necessary as long as you're comfortable with how your dataset looks.
